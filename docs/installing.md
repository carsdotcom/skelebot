# Installing

To install Skelebot, first you must copy or clone the repository onto your machine and install Python version 3.6 or later. Then, navigate
to the root of the project and execute the install.sh script.

```
> ./install.sh
```

If you do not have proper access on the machine you are using, Skelebot can be installed locally with the following command.

```
> python setup.py clean --all install --user
```

Once this is complete, you will be able to use Skelebot from anywhere on the system with the `skelebot` command.

```
> skelebot
```
