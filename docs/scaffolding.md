# Scaffolding

Scaffolding is a mechanism in Skelebot that allows for new projects to be created as Skelebot projects, as well as existing projects to be converted to Skelebot projects.

This task is only available when inside a folder that does not already contain a skelebot.yaml file (i.e. not already a Skelebot project). Inside a folder that contains the skelebot.yaml, this task will not be presented and executing the command will result in an error.

### New Projects
To scaffold a new project, navigate to an empty folder, execute 'skelebot scaffold', and follow the prompts.

```
> skelebot scaffold
```

### Existing Projects
To add Skelebot support to an existing project you can run the scaffolding command with the 'existing' param (--existing, -e). This will walk you through the same prompts but will only create the skelebot.yaml file instead of the full project structure.

```
> skelebot scaffold -e
```

### Prompts
The scaffolding command will prompt for information required in order to generate the project yaml and structure. Once you have answered all the prompts and the scaffolding is complete you will have a Skelebot project that is ready to be used.

```
>> CARS.COM | skelebot scaffold
-:---:---:---:---:---:---:---:---:---:-- SKELEBOT --:---:---:---:---:---:---:---:---:---:-
Enter a PROJECT NAME (no spaces): my-ml-project
Enter a PROJECT DESCRIPTION: A Machine Learning Project
Enter a MAINTAINER NAME: Firstname Lastname

Your skelebot is ready to go!
```

### Results
Scaffolding will always create the skelebot.yaml file, which is what defines the projects as a Skelebot project.

If scaffolding is run without the '--existing' flag, it will also create several folders for storing data, models, notebooks,  queries, output, and code. It will also generate placeholder yaml files for five different environments as well as an example bash job that can be executed through Skelebot.

The structure produced is merely a suggestion and does not need to be adhered to in order for Skelebot to function properly. The only thing Skelebot actually needs is the skelebot.yaml file. Once you have this file in your project, you can execute the help command, 'skelebot --help' and get started using it right away.
