# Publishing

Skelebot provides the ability to directly publish the projectâ€™s Docker image to a chosen repository based on user config in the skelebot.yaml file. This provides a simple, consistent method to publish the image artifact of a Skelebot project to a repository based on the Skelebot environment.

```
components:
  registry:
    host: repository.cars.com
    port: 5000
    user: skelebot
```

By default the host will be Docker Hub and the port will not be used.

The values that are provided will be structured in the name of the docker image as follows:

```
{host}:{port}/{user}/{project-name}
```

When published the current version of the project will be used as a tag as well as 'latest'.

```
skelebot publish
```

If not logged-in to the provided host in the registry, you will be prompted to enter your username and password.

If you would like to make use of any custom tags when publishing the image, the tags parameter
(`-t --tags`) can be used to specify a list of tag values.

```
skelebot publish --tags LOCAL DEV STAGE
```

### AWS ECR
Skelebot supports publishing to AWS ECR as long as you have the proper credentials setup in `~/.aws/` as well as the [aws cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed.

**Note**: If the project is set up to run on a remote machine using the `host` field (more details [here](docker-host.md)), make sure the _local_ version of the aws cli is at least 2.0, otherwise publishing will fail. ECR authentication on older versions of the aws cli below 2.0 uses a very different method that is not currently being executed on remote hosts by skelebot.

To allow for ECR host authentication, the `aws` section will need to be added to your config.

```
components:
  registry:
    host: 12345.ecr.amazonaws.com
    aws:
      region: us-east-1
      profile: dev
```

In this config the `region` field is required, but the `profile` field is optional and will make use of the default profile in your `~/.aws/` credentials if not provided.
