<h1 align='center'>Skelebot API</h1>
<div align='center'>Version 1</div>

---

### Purpose

Skelebot exposes a number of functions that can be called inside of a plugin in order to execute
and leverage important parts of the Skelebot System.

This document specifies the API contract for v1 of Skelebot.

There are packages and classes outside of this API that are technically accessible via Skelebot,
but since they are not included in this specification, they are not part of the v1 contract for
Skelebot. As such it is not advised to use any function or Class that is not specified in this
document because it may be subject to change throughout iterations of v1.
